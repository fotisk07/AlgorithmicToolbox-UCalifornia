# AlgorithmicToolbox-UCalifornia
THis repository contains the solutions in `Python 3` from the programming assignements of the Algorithmic Toolbox Tool, offered by Coursera.This is a repo in Porogress, I will be commiting as soon as I can the rest of the files.
This repo contains the solutions from all the major programming assignements in this Coursera Course.
1. Week 1 Contains some easy programming tasks
2. Week 2 has some exercises fro algorithmic "warm up"
3. Week 3 contains `"Greedy" Algorithms`
4. In Week 4 we explore the concept of `divide and conquer Algorithms`
5.In Week 5 & 6 dynamic programming is being used
